    <h2 class="hover">The Second Law Explained</h2>
    <p>Newton's second law seeks to explain the relationship between mass, acceleration, 
        and force in regards to physical collisions. The more mass or accelaration we have,
        the greater the force is. Mass is the amount of atoms in a given space, while
        acceleration is how fast those atoms are moving. If either of them are zero, we have
        zero force because either a thing of non-mass is moving, or nothing is moving. Nearly
        everything can have zero acceleration, but only photons (particles of light) have zero mass.
        Enjoy the game!

    <h2 class="hover">How this Game Came to Be...</h2>
    <p>I never took a physics class in high school, but I enjoyed programing. It took me a 
        while to realize how closely related the two can be. <br> This made me excited,
        so I ventured to complete all of Khan Academy's  high school physics course (NGSS). Then
        as a form of celebration, I supposed, I made this game and combined my enjoyment of 
        programming, physics, and art. <br> You may notice this game has no true end screen, 
        but that this is rather a tool to sharpen knowledge of the 2nd law. Also, an end screen
        just didn't feel right, and maybe there's some poetic justice there. <br>
        Because learning never ends.
